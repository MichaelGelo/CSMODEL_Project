    "The 2012 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) is a survey sample that aims to gather income and expenditure information for the Philippines and its seventeen regions. Data was gathered in two separate periods, in July 2012 and January 2013, by conducting in-person interviews with around 50,000 households. Enumerators were given thorough training and supervision to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the collected data. Supervisors carried out quality assessments, such as repeat interviews, to ensure precision. The gathered data was carefully reviewed and edited both manually and by machine, which included checks for completeness, validations for consistency, and macro edits using the FAME system. The survey attained an impressive 90.1% response rate, offering thorough socioeconomic information on family finances at national and regional levels."
