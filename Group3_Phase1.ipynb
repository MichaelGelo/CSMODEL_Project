    "The 2012 FIES began by selecting a sample based on the 2003 Master Sample, which categorized the country into primary sampling units (PSUs) by regions. Data collection occurred in two phases: the first one in July 2012 and the second one in January 2013. Interviews were held in person with households during both rounds. Enumerators received in-depth training and were closely supervised to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the gathered data. If households were not reachable or refused to take part, surveyors conducted extra visits to minimize non-response. After collecting data, a thorough verification process was carried out manually and electronically to guarantee accuracy and consistency, using specialized software to uphold data quality. This resulted in a 90.1% response rate for the survey, showing widespread participation from households across the country."
